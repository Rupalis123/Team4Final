    <h2>Age Risk Explanation</h2>
    <p>To better understand age in correlation with mortality risk, we applied clustering method using KMeans=6 with age 
        and mortality columns only. For visualization, data was grouped and sorted by predicted clusters and calculated for 
        age ranges and average mortality risk within the clusters. According to the machine learning model, cluster 0 or ages 
        over 65 were at highest risk for Covid19 mortality. This is consistent with vaccine policy of ages 65+ being one of 
        the first population groups to qualify for phase 1. Interesting to note was cluster 5 or ages 12 to 25 which had a higher 
        mortality risk than older populations. This may be due to an increase in substance abuse, unmanaged mental health illnesses 
        as seen by increase in opioid overdoses and mental health hospitalizations. A thought to consider is this age groupâ€™s 
        invincibility perception as seen by continual socialization such as Covid parties. </p>
