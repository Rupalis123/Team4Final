    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>To observe any correlation within and between the categories of pre-existing conditions and symptoms, 
    we use matplotlib and seaborn to create a correlation matrix for each feature. Higher correlation is 
    noted in patient populations who had underlying illnesses of COPD/lung disease and diabetes or COPD/lung
    disease and chronic kidney disease. Within the hypertension column, patients mostly had shortness of 
    breath followed by fatigue as a symptom. Fever and cough symptoms usually presented together followed 
    by cough and diarrhea. By using correlation matrixes with data for a specific hospital patient demographic, 
    this can be helpful for clinicians to identify trends and patterns seen in Covid19 patients.  </p>
